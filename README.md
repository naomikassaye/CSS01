# CSS01 Homework 

## Exercise 1: Profile Card Grid

- Used complex CSS selectors: element, class, descendant, attribute (`a[href^="mailto"]`), pseudo-classes (`:hover`), and pseudo-elements (`::before`).
- Each card includes a photo, name, title, and social media.
- I learned how to visually structure cards and apply dynamic effects like hover scaling.

## Exercise 2: Pricing Table
- Built 3 pricing plans using the box model.
- Used `box-sizing: content-box` on the first plan and `border-box` on the others.
- Added margin, padding, border, and tooltip hover effects using pseudo-elements.
- I understood how spacing and layout behave differently with `box-sizing`.


## Exercise 3: Hero Section
- Created a hero section using `flex`, `z-index`, and `position`.
- The nav bar is sticky and responsive.
- Hero layout adapts to smaller screens using media queries.
- I practiced combining layout tools with positioning and responsive design.
